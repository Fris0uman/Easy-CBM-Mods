# Easy-CBM-Trinity
CDDA mods to make CBM easy again

/!\ `Safe Autodoc` and `Portabe Autodoc` are not compatible, actually any mod that edits the autodoc (like `Aftershock`) will conflict with those mods. /!\
-> If you want both *safe* and *portable* autodocs use `Safe Portable Autodoc`

- **Manual Install** allows installation of CBM without autodoc.  Only works for vanilla CBMs.
- **Safe Autodoc** make surgery with autodoc succeed every time.  Not compatible with **Portable Autodoc** ( or `Aftershock`)
- **Clean CBM** makes Zombies drop ready-to-install CBM when dissected.
- **Portable Autodoc** Makes Autodoc and Autodoc couch disassemble into their portable version that can be deployed anywhere. Also adds a recipe to craft Deployable Autodoc mkII that doesn't need a couch.    Not compatible with **Safe Autodoc** ( or `Aftershock`)
- **Safe Portable Autodoc** Add content of both **Safe Autodoc** and **Portable Autodoc**.  Not compatible with `Aftershock`
